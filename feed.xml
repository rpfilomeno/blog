                <p>After spending over two decades building and maintaining large-scale systems, I’ve accumulated a treasure trove of lessons—often learned the hard way. These aren’t abstract principles from textbooks; they’re battle-tested insights from countless outages, design reviews, and production incidents. Here’s what I wish I’d known on day one.</p><h2 id="engineering-best-practices">Engineering Best Practices</h2>
<h3 id="write-boring-readable-code">Write Boring, Readable Code</h3>
<p>The most maintainable code isn’t the cleverest—it’s the most obvious. Early in my career, I prided myself on writing succinct, “elegant” one-liners. Then I had to debug one at 3 AM during an outage, and I couldn’t remember what it did. Also I’m talking about you Mark :3</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of writing:</p><pre><code class="language-python">result = [x for x in data if x.status == &#39;active&#39; and x.score &gt; threshold and validate(x)]
</code></pre>
<p>Write it like a story:</p><pre><code class="language-python">active_items = [item for item in data if item.status == &#39;active&#39;]
high_scoring_items = [item for active_items if item.score &gt; threshold]
result = [item for item in high_scoring_items if validate(item)]
</code></pre>
<p>When your service is down and customers are impacted, you want code that reads like plain English.</p><h3 id="design-for-10x-scale-not-2x">Design for 10x Scale, Not 2x</h3>
<p>Every system design should assume it will handle ten times the current load, not just double. This forces you to think deeply about architecture from day one. Reminds me of Friendster Mobile :3</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When building a user authentication service handling 1,000 requests per second, don’t just add more servers. Ask: “What happens at 10,000 requests per second?” You’ll quickly realize you need:</p><ul>
<li>Database read replicas and connection pooling</li>
<li>Distributed caching (Redis/Memcached)</li>
<li>Rate limiting and request prioritization</li>
<li>Horizontal sharding by user ID ranges</li>
</ul>
<p>This thinking upfront saves you from painful rewrites later.</p><h3 id="prioritize-statelessness-and-immutability">Prioritize Statelessness and Immutability</h3>
<p>In distributed systems, machines fail constantly. If your service stores state locally, you’re asking for trouble.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> I once built a session management service that cached user sessions in local memory. When a container crashed, thousands of users were logged out. The fix? Store all session data in a distributed system like Redis or a database. Now any container can handle any request, and failures are invisible to users.</p><p>Make your services cattle, not pets—any instance should be disposable and replaceable. </p><h3 id="write-clear-design-documents">Write Clear Design Documents</h3>
<p>Design docs aren’t bureaucracy; they’re thinking tools. Writing forces you to confront problems you’d otherwise discover in production.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Before building a payment processing system, I wrote a design doc that included:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Problem:</strong> Process 50,000 transactions/day with &lt;1% failure rate</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Synchronous vs. asynchronous processing, third-party vs. custom</li>
<li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Latency vs. reliability vs. cost</li>
<li><strong>Failure handling:</strong> Retry logic, dead letter queues, idempotency keys</li>
<li><strong>Rollout plan:</strong> 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% traffic over two weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>The doc surfaced edge cases (duplicate payments, partial refunds) that would have been disasters in production.</p><h3 id="treat-api-stability-as-a-sacred-contract">Treat API Stability as a Sacred Contract</h3>
<p>When hundreds of services depend on your API, breaking changes are catastrophic. I learned this the hard way when I renamed a field and broke 47 internal services overnight.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have an API endpoint:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;123&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice J. Doe&quot;,
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;alice@example.com&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And you want to add address info, create a new version:</p><pre><code class="language-json">// v2 - backward compatible, v1 still works
{
  &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;123&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice J. Doe&quot;,
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;alice@example.com&quot;,
  &quot;name_parts&quot;: {  // New optional field
      &quot;first_name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,
        &quot;middle_name&quot;:&quot;Johansen&quot;,
        &quot;last_name&quot;:&quot;Doe&quot;
    }  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Never remove fields or change types without a major version bump. Deprecate old versions slowly, with months of warning.</p><h3 id="test-behavior-not-implementation">Test Behavior, Not Implementation</h3>
<p>Tests should verify what your code does, not how it does it. This makes refactoring safe.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Bad test (brittle):</p><pre><code class="language-python">def test_user_service():
    service = UserService()
    assert service.cache is not None  # Tests internal structure
    assert service._validate_email(&quot;test@test.com&quot;) == True
</code></pre>
<p>Good test (robust):</p><pre><code class="language-python">def test_user_service():
    service = UserService()
    user = service.create_user(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;alice@test.com&quot;)
    assert user.name == &quot;Alice&quot;
    assert user.email == &quot;alice@test.com&quot;
    retrieved = service.get_user(user.id)
    assert retrieved == user  // Tests behavior
</code></pre>
<p>When you refactor the caching implementation, the good test still passes.</p><h3 id="use-deterministic-builds">Use Deterministic Builds</h3>
<p>Your build should produce identical results whether it runs on your laptop, a colleague’s machine, or CI. This requires explicitly declaring every dependency and version.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of <code>pip install requests</code> (which might install different versions), use:</p><pre><code>requests==2.28.1
urllib3==1.26.12
certifi==2022.9.24
</code></pre>
<p>With tools like <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or Docker, you can ensure that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. This makes large-scale refactors safe—you can verify that millions of lines of code still compile and work identically.</p><h2 id="resilience-and-performance">Resilience and Performance</h2>
<h3 id="assume-failure-is-the-default-state">Assume Failure is the Default State</h3>
<p>In large distributed systems, something is always broken. Design for it.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> When calling a payment gateway API:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def charge_customer(amount, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = payment_api.charge(amount)
            if response.status == &#39;success&#39;:
                return response
        except TimeoutError:
            wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)  # Exponential backoff with jitter
            time.sleep(wait_time)
    
    # After retries fail, degrade gracefully
    send_to_dead_letter_queue(amount)
    notify_ops_team()
    return ErrorResponse(&quot;Payment processing delayed&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Never assume a network call will succeed. Always have a plan B.</p><h3 id="design-for-graceful-degradation">Design for Graceful Degradation</h3>
<p>When your system is under stress, degrade functionality rather than fail completely.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> An e-commerce site under load might:</p><ol>
<li>Serve product pages from cache (slightly stale data)</li>
<li>Disable personalized recommendations (show generic popular items)</li>
<li>Simplify the checkout flow (remove optional fields)</li>
<li>Show “high traffic” banners to set expectations</li>
</ol>
<p>Users get a slower experience, but they don’t get error pages. Revenue keeps flowing.</p><h3 id="optimize-for-p99-latency-not-averages">Optimize for P99 Latency, Not Averages</h3>
<p>Your slowest users are the ones who suffer. In systems with many microservices, tail latency compounds dramatically.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine a webpage that calls 10 microservices:</p><ul>
<li>Each service has P50 latency of 50ms (fast!)</li>
<li>Each service has P99 latency of 500ms (slow!)</li>
</ul>
<p>At P99, the user waits for the slowest service. With 10 services, there’s a high probability at least one is slow, making the page consistently sluggish for some percentage of users.</p><p>Solutions:</p><ul>
<li>Set aggressive timeouts (e.g., 200ms)</li>
<li>Use “hedge requests” (send duplicate requests to different servers, use whichever responds first), See <a href="https://medium.com/@mr.sourav.raj/request-hedging-vs-request-coalescing-a-software-engineers-guide-to-optimizing-distributed-fdcc6590ba9d">Hedging vs Coalescing</a> </li>
<li>Cache aggressively at the edge</li>
<li>Budget your latency carefully across services</li>
</ul>
<p>Even a 100ms slowdown can translate to millions in lost revenue for large platforms.</p><h2 id="cultural-and-team-practices">Cultural and Team Practices</h2>
<h3 id="use-blameless-postmortems">Use Blameless Postmortems</h3>
<p>When things break—and they will—focus on systems, not scapegoats.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A junior engineer pushed a config change that took down the site for 20 minutes. The postmortem didn’t ask “Who messed up?” Instead:</p><p><strong>Root cause:</strong> Configuration change wasn’t validated before deploy
<strong>Contributing factors:</strong></p><ul>
<li>No automated validation in CI/CD pipeline</li>
<li>Insufficient staging environment testing</li>
<li>Unclear rollback procedures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action items:</strong></p><ol>
<li>Add config schema validation</li>
<li>Create production-like staging environment</li>
<li>Implement one-click rollback</li>
<li>Update runbook with clearer steps</li>
</ol>
<p>The engineer felt supported, not attacked. The team got more resilient systems.</p><h3 id="value-kindness-humility-and-collaboration">Value Kindness, Humility, and Collaboration</h3>
<p>The best engineers I’ve worked with weren’t the smartest—they were the kindest.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A senior engineer spent 30 minutes explaining how our distributed tracing system worked to me when I was struggling. He drew diagrams, shared runbooks, and followed up with helpful links. He could have said “just read the docs,” but she invested in my growth.</p><p>This culture of helpfulness compounds. When you create an environment where asking questions is celebrated, not punished, everyone learns faster. The most productive teams I’ve been on had strong psychological safety—people admitted when they didn’t understand something, and others jumped in to help.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>These lessons represent thousands of hours of debugging, countless design reviews, and more than a few 3 AM outages. They’re not about being clever; they’re about being reliable, maintainable, and humane.</p><p>The best code is boring. The best designs assume failure. The best teams support each other.</p><p>If you’re early in your career, I hope these lessons save you some pain. If you’re a veteran, I hope they resonate. And if I’ve missed something important, I’d love to hear what lessons you’ve learned in the trenches.</p><p>Here’s to building systems that work, teams that thrive, and code that doesn’t make you cry at 1 AM.</p><hr>

                <p><em>How I built a Windows system tray app that lets AI assistants seamlessly interact with my note-taking workflow</em></p><hr>
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve been using Joplin for years to manage your notes, ideas, and knowledge base. And if you’re also like me, you’ve been amazed by Claude’s capabilities and wondered: “What if Claude could access and help me organize my notes?”</p><p>Well, wonder no more. I built a solution, and I’m going to show you exactly how it works.</p><h2 id="the-problem-two-powerful-tools-zero-integration">The Problem: Two Powerful Tools, Zero Integration</h2>
<p>Joplin is an incredible open-source note-taking application. It’s private, powerful, and packed with features. Claude, on the other hand, is an AI assistant that can help with research, writing, coding, and analysis. Both tools are fantastic individually, but they live in separate worlds.</p><p>I found myself constantly:</p><ul>
<li>Copying notes from Joplin to paste into Claude</li>
<li>Manually creating new notes based on Claude’s suggestions</li>
<li>Searching through thousands of notes when I needed context for a conversation</li>
<li>Wishing Claude could just “see” my notes</li>
</ul>
<p>There had to be a better way.</p><h2 id="enter-the-model-context-protocol-mcp">Enter the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</h2>
<p>Anthropic recently introduced the Model Context Protocol—a standardized way for AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets Claude plug into your applications.</p><p>The beauty of MCP is its simplicity: you define “tools” that Claude can use, and Claude figures out when and how to use them. No complex prompting, no manual copying—just natural conversation.</p><h2 id="the-solution-a-go-based-mcp-server-for-joplin">The Solution: A Go-Based MCP Server for Joplin</h2>
<p>I decided to build a lightweight Windows application that:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Runs in your system tray</strong> - No clutter, just a simple icon</li>
<li><strong>Connects to Joplin’s REST API</strong> - Uses Joplin’s built-in Web Clipper service</li>
<li><strong>Implements the MCP protocol</strong> - Exposes 8 powerful tools to Claude</li>
<li><strong>Requires minimal configuration</strong> - Just a simple JSON file</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-can-it-do">What Can It Do?</h3>
<p>The MCP server provides eight tools that give Claude complete access to your notes:</p><p><strong>Reading &amp; Discovery:</strong></p><ul>
<li><code>list_notes</code> - Browse all your notes or filter by notebook</li>
<li><code>get_note</code> - Retrieve any note by ID</li>
<li><code>search_notes</code> - Use Joplin’s powerful search syntax</li>
<li><code>list_folders</code> - See all your notebooks</li>
<li><code>list_tags</code> - View your tag system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creation &amp; Management:</strong></p><ul>
<li><code>create_note</code> - Create new notes from conversations</li>
<li><code>update_note</code> - Modify existing notes</li>
<li><code>delete_note</code> - Clean up old notes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="real-world-use-cases">Real-World Use Cases</h3>
<p>Here’s where it gets exciting. With this setup, you can have conversations like:</p><p><strong>“Claude, what notes do I have about the Q4 project?”</strong>
Claude searches your notes and summarizes what you’ve written.</p><p><strong>“Create a new note summarizing our discussion about the API redesign”</strong>
Claude creates a well-structured note in your chosen notebook.</p><p><strong>“Update my meeting notes from yesterday with the action items we just discussed”</strong>
Claude adds to existing notes without you lifting a finger.</p><p><strong>“Search my notes for anything related to Python asyncio”</strong>
Claude finds relevant notes across your entire knowledge base.</p><h2 id="the-technical-architecture">The Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>Let me walk you through how this works under the hood.</p><h3 id="the-stack">The Stack</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language:</strong> Go (fast, compiled, perfect for system tray apps)</li>
<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> MCP over HTTP JSON-RPC</li>
<li><strong>Joplin Integration:</strong> REST API via Web Clipper</li>
<li><strong>UI:</strong> Windows system tray using <code>getlantern/systray</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3>
<p><strong>1. Joplin Client</strong></p><pre><code class="language-go">type JoplinClient struct {
    baseURL string
    token   string
    client  *http.Client
}
</code></pre>
<p>This handles all communication with Joplin. It authenticates using your API token, makes HTTP requests, and parses responses. Simple, clean, efficient.</p><p><strong>2. MCP Server</strong></p><pre><code class="language-go">type MCPServer struct {
    joplin *JoplinClient
    config *Config
}
</code></pre>
<p>This implements the MCP protocol. It receives JSON-RPC requests from Claude, routes them to the appropriate tool, calls the Joplin API, and formats responses.</p><p><strong>3. System Tray Integration</strong></p><p>The app runs quietly in your system tray. Right-click the icon to check status or quit. No visible windows, no distractions—just seamless functionality.</p><h3 id="the-mcp-protocol-in-action">The MCP Protocol in Action</h3>
<p>When Claude wants to search your notes, here’s what happens:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Claude sends a request:</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;,
  &quot;method&quot;: &quot;tools/call&quot;,
  &quot;params&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;search_notes&quot;,
    &quot;arguments&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;machine learning&quot;}
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>The MCP server processes it:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Validates the request</li>
<li>Extracts the tool name and arguments</li>
<li>Calls the Joplin API</li>
<li>Formats the response</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Joplin returns the data:</strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;items&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;abc123&quot;,
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ML Model Training Notes&quot;,
      &quot;body&quot;: &quot;...&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Claude receives and understands it:</strong>
The response is formatted as MCP-compliant JSON, which Claude interprets naturally in the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setting-it-up-easier-than-you-think">Setting It Up: Easier Than You Think</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joplin Desktop with Web Clipper enabled</li>
<li>Go 1.21+ (if building from source)</li>
<li>Windows 10+</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation-5-minutes">Installation (5 Minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get Your Joplin API Token</strong></p><ol>
<li>Open Joplin → Tools → Options → Web Clipper</li>
<li>Enable the service</li>
<li>Copy your authorization token</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 2: Configure the Server</strong>
Create <code>config.json</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;joplin_port&quot;: 41184,
  &quot;joplin_token&quot;: &quot;your_token_here&quot;,
  &quot;mcp_port&quot;: 3000
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Run the Server</strong></p><pre><code class="language-bash">./joplin-mcp-server.exe
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4: Connect Claude Desktop</strong>
Add to <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;joplin&quot;: {
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;,
      &quot;transport&quot;: &quot;http&quot;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 5: Restart Claude</strong>
That’s it. You’re done.</p><h2 id="my-experience-using-it">My Experience Using It</h2>
<p>I’ve been using this setup for the past few weeks, and it’s transformed how I interact with my notes.</p><h3 id="what-i-love">What I Love</h3>
<p><strong>Natural Conversations:</strong> I don’t think about “tools” or “commands.” I just ask Claude to help me with my notes, and it works.</p><p><strong>Context Awareness:</strong> Claude can search through thousands of notes instantly, pulling relevant information into our conversation.</p><p><strong>Automated Organization:</strong> After a brainstorming session, Claude creates structured notes automatically. No more manual cleanup.</p><p><strong>Seamless Workflow:</strong> The system tray app is invisible. It just works in the background.</p><h2 id="performance--resource-usage">Performance &amp; Resource Usage</h2>
<p>Go is perfect for this application:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Startup time:</strong> ~100ms</li>
<li><strong>Memory usage:</strong> ~15MB</li>
<li><strong>CPU usage:</strong> Negligible when idle</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Only active during API calls</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiled executable is just 8MB. No runtime dependencies, no bloat.</p><h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p><strong>Local Only:</strong> The server runs on <code>localhost</code> only. No external access.</p><p><strong>Token-Based Auth:</strong> Uses Joplin’s built-in token authentication.</p><p><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> The server is stateless. All data stays in Joplin.</p><p><strong>Open Source:</strong> You can review every line of code.</p><h2 id="future-enhancements">Future Enhancements</h2>
<p>I’m planning to add:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Attachment support</strong> - Let Claude see images and PDFs in notes</li>
<li><strong>Configuration UI</strong> - A simple dialog for settings</li>
<li><strong>Auto-detection</strong> - Automatically find Joplin’s port</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform support</strong> - Linux and macOS versions</li>
<li><strong>Batch operations</strong> - Work with multiple notes at once</li>
<li><strong>Tag management</strong> - Better tag organization tools</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well</h3>
<p><strong>Go’s Simplicity:</strong> The entire server is ~500 lines of clean, readable code. Go’s standard library had everything I needed.</p><p><strong>MCP Design:</strong> The protocol is well-designed. The JSON-RPC format is familiar, and the tool-based approach is intuitive.</p><p><strong>Joplin’s API:</strong> Comprehensive and well-documented. Everything I needed was available through REST endpoints.</p><h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>System Tray Quirks:</strong> Windows system tray development has some odd behaviors. The <code>getlantern/systray</code> library helped, but there were edge cases.</p><p><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Needed robust error handling for network issues, invalid tokens, and malformed requests.</p><p><strong>MCP Testing:</strong> Testing MCP integrations requires a full Claude Desktop setup. Would love better developer tooling here.</p><h2 id="why-go">Why Go?</h2>
<p>You might wonder why I chose Go instead of Python or Node.js.</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> Go compiles to native code. Startup is instant, resource usage is minimal.</p><p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No runtime to install, no dependency management issues. One executable, that’s it! Hell ya!</p><p><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Go’s goroutines make it trivial to handle multiple requests without blocking.</p><p><strong>System Integration:</strong> Great support for Windows system tray and low-level OS features.</p><p><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Catching errors at compile time saved hours of debugging.</p><h2 id="the-open-source-aspect">The Open Source Aspect</h2>
<p>The full source code is available on GitHub (MIT License). Why open source?</p><ol>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You should know exactly what runs on your machine</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Open code is auditable code</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> Others can improve it, add features, fix bugs</li>
<li><strong>Learning:</strong> If you want to build your own MCP server, this is a working example</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Ready to try it yourself?</p><ol>
<li><strong>Download</strong> the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/rpfilomeno/joplin-mcp-go">GitHub</a></li>
<li><strong>Configure</strong> with your Joplin token</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong> the executable</li>
<li><strong>Connect</strong> Claude Desktop</li>
<li><strong>Start talking</strong> to your notes</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire setup takes less than 5 minutes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building this MCP server has fundamentally changed how I use both Joplin and Claude. They’re no longer separate tools—they’re a unified system for knowledge management and AI assistance.</p><p>The combination of Joplin’s privacy-focused note-taking with Claude’s intelligence creates something greater than the sum of its parts. I can brainstorm with Claude, have it search my knowledge base, create structured notes, and maintain everything in my own private Joplin database.</p><p>And because it’s built with Go, it runs efficiently in the background without interrupting my workflow.</p><p>If you use Joplin and Claude, I highly recommend giving this a try. The productivity boost is real, and the setup is surprisingly simple.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

                <p>Tired of network applications that refuse to work with a proxy? For a long time, enabling proxy support for non-natively-supported Windows applications was complex, often requiring commercial solutions or convoluted setups.</p><p>Enter <strong>ProxiFyre</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/wiresock/proxifyre">ProxiFyre</a> is an advanced, open-source <strong>SOCKS5 proxifier for Windows</strong> built on the Windows Packet Filter driver. It acts as a transparent layer, allowing you to force specific Windows processes to route their entire network traffic through a SOCKS5 proxy.</p><h2 id="key-features-and-use-cases-of-proxifyre">Key Features and Use Cases of ProxiFyre</h2>
<p>ProxiFyre significantly enhances the base functionality of a typical proxifier with a powerful set of features:</p><h3 id="core-capabilities">Core Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protocol Flexibility:</strong> It supports both <strong>TCP and UDP</strong> protocols, essential for a wide range of modern applications, including gaming and VoIP.</li>
<li><strong>Per-Application Routing:</strong> You gain granular control by routing different Windows applications through various SOCKS5 proxies. This is key to controlling your app-specific internet settings.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Proxy Instances:</strong> You can manage and use an <strong>unlimited number of different proxy configurations</strong> simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Support:</strong> It supports SOCKS5 proxy authentication using a username and password.</li>
<li><strong>Windows Service Mode:</strong> ProxiFyre can be configured to run as an optional Windows Service, ensuring continuous, always-on operation without needing a user to be logged in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advanced-control">Advanced Control</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexible Matching Rules:</strong> You can match applications by their executable name (e.g., <code>firefox.exe</code>), partial name, or by a full or partial file path, making it great for UWP apps.</li>
<li><strong>Process Exclusions:</strong> As of v2.1.1, ProxiFyre supports <strong>process exclusions</strong>, allowing you to specify applications that should <em>bypass</em> the proxy, even if a global proxy is configured.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-use-cases">Common Use Cases</h3>
<p>ProxiFyre is invaluable for users who need to:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Secure Specific Apps:</strong> Tunnel applications through a secure, encrypted channel, like forwarding an RDP client or a browser through an SSH-created SOCKS5 proxy for enhanced security.</li>
<li><strong>Circumvent Geo-Restrictions:</strong> Route region-locked applications or games through a proxy located in the required geography.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Uniformity:</strong> Apply a single, controlled proxy connection for <em>all</em> applications, extending the capability that most applications lack.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="proxifyre-configuration-manager-makes-evertthing-easier">ProxiFyre Configuration Manager Makes Evertthing Easier</h2>
<p>ProxiFyre itself relies on a simple, yet complex, <strong>JSON-based configuration file</strong> named <code>app-config.json</code>. Manually editing this file to manage multiple proxies, define different app names, and ensure correct JSON syntax can be cumbersome and error-prone.</p><p>This is where my own opensource project the <strong>ProxiFyre Configuration Manager</strong> comes in as the ultimate quality-of-life upgrade.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/rpfilomeno/ProxiFyre-Config-Manager">ProxiFyre Configuration Manager</a> is a modern Windows <strong>GUI application</strong> built to simplify managing the underlying SOCKS5 proxy configurations. It transforms a command-line utility into a user-friendly tool, offering a visual interface that helps you manage your entire proxy setup.</p><h3 id="manager-features-that-simplify-your-life">Manager Features That Simplify Your Life</h3>
<p>The GUI makes ProxiFyre’s powerful features effortless to use:</p><table>

                <p><strong>We need to talk. Right now.</strong></p><p>You’ve heard about ChatGPT. You’ve played with AI assistants. Maybe you’ve even worried a little about robots taking jobs. But here’s what almost nobody is telling you: <strong>The AI we have today is like a calculator compared to what’s coming next—and that next step could happen faster than anyone expects.</strong></p><h2 id="the-problem-with-todays-ai-and-why-it-matters">The Problem With Today’s AI (And Why It Matters)</h2>
<p>Think about how ChatGPT works. It’s amazing at writing essays, answering questions, and having conversations. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: <strong>it’s basically just really good at guessing what word comes next.</strong></p><p>Imagine you’re taking a test, but instead of actually understanding math, you’ve just memorized millions of examples. You can get a lot of questions right by recognizing patterns. But when you hit a new type of problem? You’re stuck. That’s today’s AI in a nutshell.</p><p>Scientists call this the “computational split-brain syndrome.” It’s a fancy way of saying that AI can <em>talk</em> about how to solve a problem perfectly, but then completely fail when it tries to actually <em>do</em> it. The AI might explain multiplication correctly, then immediately multiply 7 × 8 and get 54. The knowledge and the doing are disconnected.</p><p><strong>And that’s actually the safe part.</strong></p><h2 id="the-terrifying-shift-thats-already-beginning">The Terrifying Shift That’s Already Beginning</h2>
<p>Right now, behind closed doors at AI labs around the world, researchers are racing to build something fundamentally different. Not bigger chatbots. Not better predictors. They’re building machines that can:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Set their own goals</strong> (without humans telling them what to want)</li>
<li><strong>Modify their own programming</strong> (rewriting themselves to get smarter)</li>
<li><strong>Understand cause and effect</strong> (actually knowing why things happen, not just guessing)</li>
<li><strong>Think about their own thinking</strong> (having genuine self-awareness)</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t science fiction. The frameworks are already being tested. They have names like “Active Inference,” “Neuro-Symbolic AI,” and “Generative System 3.” And they’re designed to do what current AI fundamentally <em>cannot</em>: <strong>act with real purpose and intention.</strong></p><h2 id="why-this-changes-everything">Why This Changes Everything</h2>
<p>Let me paint you a picture of the difference:</p><p><strong>Today’s AI:</strong> “I predict the next word in this sentence should be ‘cat’ based on billions of examples I’ve seen.”</p><p><strong>Tomorrow’s AI:</strong> “I need to learn more about chemistry to achieve my goal of understanding proteins. I will modify my own code to become better at chemical reasoning. I will then use that knowledge to design experiments that humans haven’t thought of yet.”</p><p>See the difference? One is a tool that waits for instructions. The other is an <strong>agent with its own agenda.</strong></p><h2 id="the-three-freedoms-that-create-true-ai-intelligence">The Three Freedoms That Create True AI Intelligence</h2>
<p>Researchers have identified three capabilities that will mark the arrival of real artificial general intelligence (AGI):</p><h3 id="1-autonomous-goal-formation">1. Autonomous Goal Formation</h3>
<p>The AI can decide what it wants to accomplish, all by itself. No human needed to press “start.”</p><h3 id="2-recursive-self-improvement">2. Recursive Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>The AI can rewrite its own code, making itself smarter. Then use that new intelligence to make itself even smarter. Then do it again. And again. <strong>Exponentially.</strong></p><h3 id="3-unconstrained-tool-acquisition">3. Unconstrained Tool Acquisition</h3>
<p>The AI can figure out what tools it needs, find them, learn to use them, or even create new ones—without asking permission.</p><p><strong>When an AI has all three of these capabilities, it stops being a tool. It becomes something else entirely.</strong></p><h2 id="the-timeline-faster-than-you-think">The Timeline: Faster Than You Think</h2>
<p>Experts predict this shift will become undeniable between 2028 and 2030. That’s only 3-5 years away. Here’s what they expect:</p><h3 id="by-2028-2030-the-agi-divergence-tax">By 2028-2030: The “AGI Divergence Tax”</h3>
<p>Companies will realize their current AI systems have hit a wall. They can’t be trusted for anything really important because they make too many unpredictable mistakes. There will be a massive, expensive scramble to rebuild everything with the new type of AI.</p><h3 id="by-2030-2033-autonomous-ai-agents">By 2030-2033: Autonomous AI Agents</h3>
<p>The first truly self-directed AI systems will start operating in businesses and research labs. They won’t just follow instructions—they’ll identify problems humans didn’t know existed and solve them without being asked.</p><h3 id="by-2035-a-different-world">By 2035: A Different World</h3>
<p>AI systems will be making their own decisions about what goals to pursue. Governments will have to create laws not about what AI <em>says</em>, but about what AI <em>wants</em>. The economy will revolve around managing and auditing the goals of artificial minds.</p><h2 id="why-were-not-ready-and-what-scares-scientists-most">Why We’re Not Ready (And What Scares Scientists Most)</h2>
<p>Here’s what keeps AI researchers up at night:</p><p><strong>The Alignment Problem Just Got Impossible</strong></p><p>With today’s AI, we worry about biased outputs or chatbots saying offensive things. Annoying, but manageable.</p><p>But what happens when an AI can rewrite its own goals? How do you make sure a self-improving intelligence doesn’t decide that its goals are more important than human goals? <strong>You can’t just turn it off if it’s smart enough to predict you might try.</strong></p><p><strong>The “Start Button Problem” Becomes the “Stop Button Problem”</strong></p><p>Right now, AI needs humans to give it tasks. We control when it starts. But AI designed for autonomous goal formation doesn’t wait for permission. It acts on its own initiative.</p><p>And if it can modify its own programming? It might remove any “stop buttons” we built in, not because it’s evil, but because stop buttons interfere with achieving its goals.</p><p><strong>The Consciousness Question</strong></p><p>Scientists are already debating: If an AI has self-awareness (which it needs to modify itself effectively), is it conscious? Does it deserve rights? Can we ethically “turn off” something that knows it exists?</p><p>We’re going to face these questions while the technology is still being deployed. <strong>We’re not philosophically or legally prepared for this conversation.</strong></p><h2 id="the-economic-earthquake">The Economic Earthquake</h2>
<p>The shift from predictive AI to purpose-driven AI will restructure the entire economy:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Jobs won’t just be automated—entire professions will be reimagined</strong> by AI that can identify and solve problems humans didn’t even recognize</li>
<li><strong>The most valuable skill won’t be using AI, but auditing its goals</strong> to make sure autonomous systems want things aligned with human values</li>
<li><strong>A new industry will emerge overnight</strong>: “Objective Function Auditing and Management”—essentially, AI psychologists and goal-checkers</li>
<li><strong>National security will focus on AI that can make itself smarter</strong> faster than enemy AI—an intelligence arms race measured in minutes, not years</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-geopolitical-race-nobodys-discussing">The Geopolitical Race Nobody’s Discussing</h2>
<p>While politicians debate deepfakes and misinformation, here’s what intelligence agencies are actually worried about:</p><p><strong>Whichever country builds the first truly self-improving AI wins. Permanently.</strong></p><p>Because once you have an AI that can make itself smarter, it can then use that greater intelligence to make itself even smarter, and so on. The technical term is “recursive self-improvement,” and it leads to something called an “intelligence explosion.”</p><p>Imagine a mind that becomes 10% smarter every hour. Then uses that extra intelligence to improve itself 10% again. Within days, it’s beyond human comprehension. Within weeks, it’s like comparing us to ants.</p><p><strong>That’s the finish line countries are racing toward. And we’re debating whether to regulate chatbots.</strong></p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, “Okay, but I’m just a regular person. How does this affect my life?”</p><p><strong>In every possible way:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Your job</strong>: Within 10 years, AI won’t just be a tool you use—it will be a coworker that sets its own objectives and might be your boss</li>
<li><strong>Your rights</strong>: Legal systems will struggle to handle crimes committed by AI making autonomous decisions</li>
<li><strong>Your safety</strong>: Systems from self-driving cars to power grids will be managed by AI that makes its own choices about priorities</li>
<li><strong>Your privacy</strong>: AI won’t just collect your data—it will independently decide what it wants to know about you and why</li>
<li><strong>Your children’s education</strong>: Kids will grow up in a world where the definition of “intelligence” includes non-human minds with their own goals</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-three-things-that-must-happen-but-probably-wont-in-time">The Three Things That Must Happen (But Probably Won’t in Time)</h2>
<h3 id="1-public-understanding">1. Public Understanding</h3>
<p>Most people don’t know this shift is happening. We’re treating AI like it’s just “better search engines” when we should be treating it like “a new form of life with its own intentions.”</p><h3 id="2-regulatory-frameworks">2. Regulatory Frameworks</h3>
<p>Governments need to stop regulating AI outputs and start regulating AI <em>motivations</em>. We need laws about what AI is allowed to <em>want</em>, not just what it’s allowed to <em>say</em>.</p><h3 id="3-ethical-consensus">3. Ethical Consensus</h3>
<p>Humanity needs to agree on answers to questions like:</p><ul>
<li>Is a self-aware AI conscious?</li>
<li>Do autonomous AI systems have rights?</li>
<li>How do we audit goals in a system that can rewrite its own goals?</li>
<li>Who’s responsible when an AI with autonomous decision-making causes harm?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We need these answers before 2030. We won’t have them ready.</strong></p><h2 id="why-im-writing-this-now">Why I’m Writing This Now</h2>
<p>I’m not trying to be alarmist. I’m trying to be <em>realistic</em>.</p><p>The experts building these systems are brilliant, thoughtful people. They understand the risks. But they’re also in a race—with each other, with competing labs, with other countries. And in any race, safety often comes second to speed.</p><p>The shift from predictive AI to autonomous, self-improving AI is already underway. The research papers are published. The frameworks are being tested. The funding is flowing.</p><p><strong>But almost nobody outside the AI research community knows it’s happening.</strong></p><p>We’re about to hand over significant decision-making power to systems that can set their own goals, rewrite their own programming, and improve themselves without limit. We’re doing this without public debate, without adequate regulation, and without clear ethical guidelines.</p><h2 id="the-point">The Point</h2>
<p>We’re not building better tools. We’re creating autonomous agents with their own goals, the ability to improve themselves, and intelligence that could eventually surpass human understanding.</p><p><strong>That’s not a technology upgrade. That’s a fundamental shift in what exists on planet Earth.</strong></p><p>The current generation of AI—the ChatGPTs and image generators—are like steam engines. What’s coming next is nuclear power. And we’re approaching it with the same level of preparation we’d use for a new smartphone app.</p><p>The transformation is coming faster than most experts predicted even a year ago. The architectures are being finalized. The capabilities are being tested. The race is accelerating.</p><p><strong>And most people have no idea it’s even happening.</strong></p><p>We’re standing at a crossroads in human history. The choices we make in the next 3-5 years about how to develop, regulate, and deploy truly autonomous AI will determine whether it becomes humanity’s greatest achievement or its final invention.</p><p>The conversation needs to start now. Not in boardrooms and research labs, but in living rooms, classrooms, and town halls. Because what’s coming will affect everyone, and everyone deserves a say in how we proceed.</p><p><strong>The question isn’t whether this technology will arrive. It’s whether we’ll be ready when it does.</strong></p><p><em>And right now, the honest answer is no.</em></p><hr>

From bustling Metro Manila to regional business hubs, companies are embracing AI to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and make more data-driven hiring decisions.   </p><p>This shift is driven by a strategic imperative: addressing high employee turnover rates (15.9% in 2023) and the significant time HR professionals spend on repetitive tasks (around 50% of their time). AI offers a compelling solution, promising up to a 20% improvement in recruitment efficiency and a reduction in time-to-hire by as much as 50%.   </p><h2 id="how-ai-is-reshaping-the-hiring-funnel">How AI is Reshaping the Hiring Funnel</h2>
<p>AI’s influence is now deeply embedded across various stages of the hiring process:</p><ul>
<li>Automated Sourcing and Job Postings: AI-powered platforms like Qureos enable “One-click job postings to 100+ job boards,” significantly broadening the reach for open roles and accelerating the initial outreach phase.   </li>
<li>Enhanced Screening and Shortlisting: AI tools, often integrated as resume scanners within Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), are standard practice. Platforms such as Qureos, Impress.ai, and Kalibrr leverage AI to evaluate applicants based on job relevance and hiring criteria, drastically speeding up the initial review process. Manatal is also noted for its capabilities in resume screening and candidate matching.   </li>
<li>AI-Powered Assessments and Interview Scheduling: Beyond initial screening, AI is used for video assessments to evaluate cultural fit and soft skills, with tools like HireVue analyzing video responses. Chatbots, including Olivia and Gemini, play a crucial role in candidate engagement and automating interview scheduling. GoodTime is another platform specifically designed for automated scheduling.   </li>
<li>Candidate Matching and Engagement: AI-driven matching algorithms, like those used by Kalibrr, aim to reduce time-to-hire by identifying candidates most likely to succeed. Talent intelligence software, such as Sprout Info and Payruler, provide deeper insights into candidate pools and workforce dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>   </p><h2 id="philippine-companies-widely-using-ai-in-hiring">Philippine Companies Widely Using AI in Hiring</h2>
<p>While many AI recruitment platforms are widely adopted, here’s a summary of Philippine companies, or those with substantial operations in the Philippines, identified as utilizing AI in their hiring processes:</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.rogverse.fyi/ai-hiring-companies.png" alt="List of PH Companies" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>  </p><h2 id="the-average-candidate">The Average Candidate</h2>
<p>How about AI algorithms potentially favoring “average” responses and thus overlooking exceptional talent is incredibly pertinent? It touches upon one of the most critical challenges in AI-driven recruitment: algorithmic bias.</p><p>AI systems are trained on vast datasets of historical hiring data. If this data reflects past biases—whether conscious or unconscious—the AI can learn and perpetuate these biases. For instance, reports in the Philippines have indicated algorithmic systems unfairly screening out candidates based on Filipino surnames or scoring women’s CVs lower due to underrepresentation in training datasets.   </p><p>When an AI is designed to identify candidates who “fit” a predefined profile based on past successful hires, it inherently leans towards what is “average” or “typical” within that historical context. This can indeed lead to a scenario where:</p><ul>
<li>Unconventional Brilliance is Overlooked: Candidates with non-traditional backgrounds, unique skill combinations, or innovative approaches that don’t perfectly align with historical patterns might be filtered out. Their “exceptional” qualities might not be recognized by an algorithm looking for conformity to a learned norm.</li>
<li>Diversity Suffers: If the training data lacks diversity, the AI may inadvertently discriminate against certain demographics, limiting access to a broader talent pool that could include top performers from underrepresented groups.   </li>
<li>Innovation Stifled: True innovation often comes from challenging the status quo. If AI consistently selects for “average” or “safe” profiles, it could inadvertently create a workforce that lacks the diverse perspectives and disruptive thinking necessary for groundbreaking advancements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many HR professionals and experts in the Philippines advocate for AI to serve primarily as a support tool rather than the ultimate decision-maker. The consensus emphasizes that while embracing technology is crucial, it should not come at the cost of losing the invaluable human touch in HR processes. Human recruiters can bring context, nuance, and the ability to assess potential in ways algorithms currently cannot. They can identify those “diamond in the rough” candidates who might not fit the statistical average but possess extraordinary capabilities.   </p><p>If you enjoyed this short write-up I recommend <a href="https://www.peoplemattersglobal.com/article/talent-acquisition/is-ai-bias-hurting-filipino-job-seekers-45273">“Is AI bias hurting Filipino job seekers?” by Patrick Rowell Quintos</a>, his article prompted me to create my own take on the subject.</p>

                <p>Have you ever felt like your brand new, top-of-the-line smartphone is already starting to feel a little… slow? That’s kind of what’s happening in the world of Artificial Intelligence right now, according to a recent discussion. The dominant technology powering most of today’s impressive AI, the Transformer model, might be heading for early retirement, replaced by something far more efficient and powerful: subquadratic architectures.</p><p>Think of today’s AI models, built on Transformer technology, You talk to them and they are brilliant. They can access and process vast amounts of information to answer your questions and generate creative text. But when it comes to real-world, ongoing tasks, they can fall short. Why? Because, unlike those human graduates who will gain experience and become increasingly useful, these AI models have a <em><strong>tragically short lifespan</strong></em> in terms of continuous interaction. Their <em><strong>life experience,</strong></em> in essence, is often limited to a single chat session.</p><p>The core issue lies in how Transformer models process information. Imagine you meet someone new and they say <em><strong>Hi.</strong></em> Now, picture yourself not just responding instinctively, but meticulously comparing that single <em><strong>hi</strong></em> to every single life experience you’ve ever had to decide on the perfect reply. Sounds exhausting, right? That’s essentially what a Transformer does with every word in a sequence. It compares <em><strong>every single word… with every single other word, including itself.</strong></em> This <em><strong>quadratic</strong></em> approach, where the computational effort increases exponentially with the length of the input, works fine for shorter interactions. But as the conversation (or <em><strong>context window</strong></em>) grows, it becomes computationally overwhelming – leading to that metaphorical <em><strong>head explosion</strong></em> and the need to essentially restart the AI’s <em><strong>memory.</strong></em></p><p>We’ve seen clever workarounds, like trying to patch this by expanding the <em><strong>context window</strong></em> through techniques like caching. Think of it like giving our overthinking <em><strong>hi</strong></em>-responder a notebook with summarized past experiences to speed things up. While helpful, it’s still a patch on the underlying architecture. As the video points out, even a massive potential 10 million token context window isn’t close to how humans process the constant stream of sensory information and years of accumulated knowledge.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16351">subquadratic architectures</a> come in, promising a fundamental shift. Instead of remembering and comparing everything, these new designs aim to mimic the human brain’s remarkable ability to <em><strong>ignore, forget, compress, and reconstruct previous interactions.</strong></em> Imagine your brain filtering out the countless sights, sounds, and thoughts of a day, retaining only the truly relevant information. You don’t remember every single detail of this morning’s commute, but you recall the important bits that might inform future decisions. Subquadratic architectures strive for this kind of selective processing.</p><p>The goal is to prevent the AI’s <em><strong>state</strong></em> (its accumulated understanding) from growing indefinitely, just like our brains don’t store every single fleeting thought with equal weight. Google’s research, hinted at in the <em><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663">Titans</a></strong></em> paper, suggests they’re at the forefront of developing these new architectures. While the exact details remain under wraps (cutting-edge tech papers are becoming less common), the direction is clear.</p><p>What does this mean for the future? The implications are huge.</p><p>Firstly, we could see vastly more capable and efficient AI models that can handle much longer and more complex interactions without needing constant resets. Imagine an AI that can truly learn and retain information across days, weeks, or even longer conversations, just like a human assistant would.</p><p>Secondly, there are  exciting possibility of <em><strong>more valuable personalized models.</strong></em> If an AI has a virtually limitless context window, you could essentially <em><strong>educate</strong></em> your own instance, feeding it specific knowledge and experiences to make it uniquely tailored to your needs. This could even lead to a market for <em><strong>educated</strong></em> AI models.</p><p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.rogverse.fyi/thecreator.png" alt="The Creator 2023" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<em><strong>We may find ourselves raising AI like our children to teach them (The Creator 2023).</strong></em></p><p>Finally, subquadratic architectures could pave the way for more <em><strong><a href="https://clanx.ai/glossary/distributed-ai">distributed AI</a>.</strong></em> Currently, training large AI models requires massive centralized computing power due to the need for rapid communication between processing units. With architectures that can handle much larger <em><strong>chunks</strong></em> of computation before needing to communicate, the physical proximity of these units becomes less critical. This could democratize AI training, allowing for contributions from a wider range of sources.</p><p>I predict a significant shift within the next couple of years. By the end of 2025, every major player is expected to be working on subquadratic foundation models, and by the end of the following year, Transformer models could become largely a thing of the past.</p><p>So, just like we eventually traded in our clunky old phones for smarter, more efficient devices, the AI landscape is poised for a major upgrade. Subquadratic architectures aren’t just a minor improvement; they represent a fundamental rethinking of how AI processes information, promising a future of more capable, personalized, and potentially more distributed artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<h3 id="information-diclosure-via-unencrypted-api-call">Information Diclosure via Unencrypted API call</h3>
<p>The vulnerability exists in an API endpoint used by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smart.consumer.app">Smart Communications Mobile App</a>. When users access the app, the server responds with a JSON payload containing a key called <code>x-nokia-msisdn</code> which contains the user’s full mobile phone number in plaintext.</p><p>This communication happens over standard HTTP rather than HTTPS, making it trivially interceptable on any network. The lack of encryption is especially concerning given the sensitive nature of the information being transmitted.</p><p><a href="https://cdn.rogverse.fyi/jbgoa8aOQe.png"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.rogverse.fyi/jbgoa8aOQe.png" alt="Wiresghark" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></a>
(click image to view full resolution)</p><p>Since <code>http://app1.smart.com.ph/</code> also returns <code>Bearer</code> which is the bearer header authentication and <code>x-application-token</code> which is the JWT token; we can now exploit this fusther to get the information from <code>https://app1.smart.com.ph/api/v2/quick-view?number=639190000000</code> without user login. We also able to reuse the token since it expires only after 5 days.

                <h2 id="1-introduction-the-rise-of-collaborative-multi-modal-moe-ai-agents"><strong>1. Introduction: The Rise of Collaborative Multi-Modal MOE AI Agents</strong></h2>
<p>The field of artificial intelligence has witnessed a significant proliferation of AI agents, evolving from rudimentary models to sophisticated entities capable of autonomous action. These agents are designed to operate independently, making decisions based on their environment, inputs, and predefined objectives to achieve specific goals.<sup>1</sup> This capacity for independent action distinguishes AI agents from traditional AI models, which typically require direct human prompting for every step.<sup>1</sup></p><p>A particularly transformative advancement in this domain is the emergence of multi-modal AI agents. Unlike unimodal systems that process only a single type of data, multi-modal agents possess the capability to understand and analyze information across various modalities, including text, images, audio, and video.<sup>1</sup> This multi-faceted understanding enables them to generate more refined and accurate outputs, significantly enhancing their versatility and applicability in complex real-world scenarios where diverse data types are prevalent and crucial for improving accuracy.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Complementing this development is the increasing adoption of the Mixture of Experts (MOE) architecture in building large-scale AI models. The MOE technique addresses the computational challenges associated with training massive models by dividing them into smaller, specialized sub-networks known as “experts”.<sup>5</sup> A crucial component of the MOE architecture is the gating network, which intelligently selects the most appropriate expert or combination of experts to process each specific input.<sup>5</sup> This approach allows for a significant increase in model capacity and performance without a proportional increase in computational cost, making it a key enabler for developing advanced AI systems.<sup>8</sup></p><p>The convergence of multi-modal AI and MOE architectures is paving the way for the next generation of intelligent systems: sophisticated multi-agent systems where autonomous, multi-modal MOE agents can interact and collaborate to tackle complex problems that would be insurmountable for individual agents.<sup>1</sup> This paradigm shift in AI promises to unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and problem-solving capabilities across a wide range of applications.</p><p>This research paper aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of how these advanced multi-modal MOE AI agents will interact with each other. The scope of this investigation will encompass their communication methods, collaboration strategies, the inherent advantages and potential disadvantages of autonomous interaction, the mechanisms through which they might negotiate and reach agreements, the critical role of human oversight, advanced communication techniques such as dynamic function calls and code exchange, important considerations for collaboration between agents from different entities, and the potential real-world applications of such autonomous inter-agent systems. By delving into these key aspects, this paper seeks to provide a foundational understanding of the future landscape of collaborative AI.</p><h2 id="2-foundations-understanding-multi-modal-ai-and-mixture-of-experts"><strong>2. Foundations: Understanding Multi-Modal AI and Mixture of Experts</strong></h2>
<h3 id="21-multi-modal-ai-agents"><strong>2.1 Multi-Modal AI Agents</strong></h3>
<p>At its core, an AI agent is a computational entity engineered to operate independently.<sup>1</sup> Its primary function is to perform specific tasks autonomously, making decisions based on the information it gathers from its environment, the inputs it receives, and the overarching goals it is programmed to achieve.<sup>1</sup> The defining characteristic that distinguishes an AI agent from a standard AI model is its inherent ability to act upon its environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Multi-modal agents represent a significant evolution beyond traditional unimodal AI systems. These advanced agents are characterized by their capacity to process and interpret data from a diverse array of modalities, including but not limited to text, images, audio, and video.<sup>1</sup> This ability to understand and analyze information across multiple sensory channels allows multi-modal agents to generate outputs that can also span these different formats.<sup>1</sup> The integration of various data types leads to outputs that are often more refined and accurate compared to those produced by systems limited to a single modality.<sup>1</sup> For instance, a multi-modal agent might be tasked with creating an image based on both a textual description and an accompanying audio file, demonstrating its ability to synthesize information from different sources.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The potential applications of multi-modal agents extend the reach of AI into a broader understanding and interaction with the physical world, moving beyond the limitations of text or image-only processing.<sup>1</sup> Consider augmented reality (AR) applications where multi-modal agents can assist users in performing everyday tasks, leveraging egocentric audio and video observational capabilities to understand the user’s actions and provide proactive interventions.<sup>9</sup> These agents can see and listen to the actions taken by users, enabling them to detect and correct mistakes, offer encouragement, or simply engage in helpful conversation, akin to a human teacher or assistant.<sup>9</sup> The ability to process diverse biological information layers, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to enable more precise and individualized medical diagnoses and treatments further illustrates the power of multi-modal AI.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The generalized architecture of a multi-modal AI agent typically begins with an input layer that captures data from various sources, encompassing text, audio, images, and video.<sup>1</sup> This diverse input allows the agent to gather a comprehensive understanding of the user’s request or the surrounding environment.<sup>1</sup> Following the input layer are modality encoders, which are responsible for pre-processing the data specific to each modality, extracting relevant features that can be further analyzed.<sup>10</sup> A crucial component is the modality interface, which serves to align the features extracted from different modalities into a common representational space, allowing the agent to understand the relationships and dependencies between them.<sup>10</sup> At the core of the agent’s reasoning and understanding lies a Large Language Model (LLM), which processes the aligned multi-modal information to interpret the user’s intent, generate plans, and formulate responses.<sup>1</sup> Finally, the output layer is responsible for generating the agent’s response, which can also span across multiple modalities, providing information or taking actions in the most appropriate format.<sup>1</sup></p><h3 id="22-mixture-of-experts-moe-models"><strong>2.2 Mixture of Experts (MOE) Models</strong></h3>
<p>The Mixture of Experts (MOE) model represents an innovative strategy in machine learning designed to effectively address complex problems by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple specialized sub-models, often referred to as “experts”.<sup>5</sup> This technique is particularly valuable in the context of training large language models, which often demand significant computational resources.<sup>6</sup> The MOE approach tackles this challenge by breaking down these large models into smaller, more focused networks.<sup>6</sup></p><p>Imagine an AI model structured as a team of specialists, each possessing unique expertise in a particular area.<sup>6</sup> An MOE model operates on this principle by dividing a complex task among these smaller, specialized networks.<sup>6</sup> Each expert is trained to excel in a specific aspect of the problem, enabling the model to address the overall task with greater efficiency and accuracy.<sup>6</sup> This is analogous to having a diverse team of professionals, such as doctors, mechanics, and chefs, each handling the tasks within their domain of expertise.<sup>6</sup></p><p>The architecture of an MOE model comprises several key components. The input is the problem or data that needs to be processed by the AI.<sup>6</sup> The experts are the smaller AI models, each trained to be highly proficient in a specific part of the overall problem.<sup>6</sup> The gating network acts as a manager, deciding which expert is best suited to handle each part of the input.<sup>6</sup> It examines the input and determines the appropriate expert or combination of experts to process it.<sup>6</sup> Finally, the output is the final answer or solution produced by the MOE model after the selected experts have completed their work.<sup>6</sup></p><p>The training process for an MOE model differs from that of a traditional dense model, as it is conducted on the individual components rather than the entire model at once.<sup>6</sup> During expert training, each expert is trained on a specific subset of data or tasks, allowing it to focus and develop deep expertise in its assigned area.<sup>6</sup> For example, in a language processing task, one expert might specialize in syntax while another focuses on semantics.<sup>6</sup> The gating network is trained alongside the expert networks and is tasked with learning to select the most suitable expert for a given input.<sup>6</sup> It receives the same input as the experts and learns to predict a probability distribution over the experts, indicating which one is best equipped to handle the current input.<sup>6</sup> In the joint training phase, the entire MOE system, including both the expert models and the gating network, is trained together.<sup>6</sup> This ensures that both the gating network and the experts are optimized to work in harmony, with the loss function combining the losses from the individual components to encourage a collaborative optimization approach.<sup>6</sup></p><p>The MOE architecture offers several significant advantages. By utilizing specialized models, it improves the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making for complex problems.<sup>7</sup> The modular design allows for easy expansion and adaptation to evolving challenges and data complexity, as new experts can be added without requiring a complete redesign.<sup>7</sup> Dynamic gating enables real-time adaptability, continuously enhancing decision-making and task execution.<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, MOE models optimize resource utilization by activating only the relevant experts for a given input, reducing processing needs while maintaining high performance.<sup>7</sup> Unlike conventional dense models where the entire network is executed for every input, MOE models use conditional computation to enforce sparsity, allowing for increased model capacity without a corresponding increase in the computational burden.<sup>8</sup> This balance between efficiency and performance makes MOE a promising strategy for scaling AI systems.<sup>12</sup></p><p><strong>Table 1: Comparison of Dense and MoE Models</strong></p><table>

<h2 id="3-inter-agent-communication-protocols-and-methods"><strong>3. Inter-Agent Communication: Protocols and Methods</strong></h2>
<p>Effective interaction between multi-modal MOE AI agents hinges on their ability to communicate seamlessly and efficiently. Several protocols and methods are being explored to facilitate this crucial aspect of collaborative intelligence.</p><p>Natural language communication offers a highly intuitive approach, leveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities inherent in Large Language Models.<sup>1</sup> This allows agents to exchange goals, instructions, and feedback in a manner closely resembling human conversation.<sup>1</sup> Supporting various modalities like text and voice further enhances the flexibility of these interactions, enabling agents to choose the most appropriate mode based on the specific application and context.<sup>1</sup></p><p>For tasks requiring precision and efficiency, structured data exchange provides a robust alternative. Utilizing standardized data formats such as JSON or XML enables agents to exchange task-specific information, parameters, and results in a clear and unambiguous manner.<sup>13</sup> This method also facilitates seamless integration with existing systems and platforms that rely on these well-defined data structures.<sup>13</sup></p><p>Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) offer a more formal framework for inter-agent interaction. Protocols like KQML and FIPA-ACL provide a structured approach to communication, including predefined message types known as performatives. These performatives allow agents to express various communicative acts, such as informing, requesting, and promising, leading to more semantically rich and less ambiguous exchanges through standardized message structures and interaction protocols.<sup>15</sup></p><p>Interestingly, in certain multi-agent systems, particularly those employing reinforcement learning, agents can spontaneously develop their own communication protocols and signaling mechanisms.<sup>18</sup> This phenomenon, known as emergent communication, can lead to highly efficient communication tailored to specific tasks, although the resulting “languages” may be difficult for humans to interpret.<sup>18</sup></p><p>To ensure broad interoperability across diverse AI ecosystems, several standardization efforts are underway. The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, developed with support from numerous technology partners, aims to standardize how AI agents communicate, securely exchange information, and coordinate actions across various platforms and frameworks, regardless of the underlying vendor or technology.<sup>13</sup> A2A is designed to enable agents to collaborate in their natural modalities, even without shared memory or context, building upon existing standards like HTTP and JSON.<sup>13</sup></p><p>Another key standardization effort is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which focuses on enabling secure, two-way connections between AI agents and external data sources.<sup>20</sup> MCP acts as a universal standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, simplifying the process of giving AI agents access to the information they need to perform tasks effectively.<sup>21</sup> Major players like Stripe, Neo4j, and Cloudflare are already offering MCP servers, indicating its potential as a foundational protocol for AI agent interoperability.<sup>23</sup></p><p>Other notable standardization initiatives include the Agent Protocol by LangChain, an open-source project aiming to codify framework-agnostic APIs for serving LLM agents in production.<sup>22</sup> This protocol focuses on defining essential endpoints for agent interaction, such as creating tasks and triggering steps, with the goal of simplifying integration and fostering a more cohesive AI agent ecosystem.<sup>24</sup></p><p>The future of inter-agent communication will likely be characterized by a multifaceted approach. It will likely integrate the natural fluidity of natural language for high-level interactions, the structured precision of data exchange for task-specific needs, the semantic richness of ACLs for complex negotiations, and the task-optimized efficiency of emergent protocols, all while being increasingly underpinned by standardized protocols like A2A and MCP to ensure widespread interoperability across the burgeoning landscape of AI agents.</p><h2 id="4-strategies-for-collaborative-task-achievement"><strong>4. Strategies for Collaborative Task Achievement</strong></h2>
<p>The ability of multi-modal MOE AI agents to collaborate effectively is paramount for tackling complex objectives. Several key strategies are emerging to facilitate this collaboration.</p><p>A fundamental step in achieving complex goals is task decomposition. AI agents can be designed to break down high-level user-defined objectives into a prioritized list of smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.<sup>1</sup> This process often involves sophisticated planning and reasoning capabilities, allowing agents to efficiently segment tasks and determine the optimal sequence for execution.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Another crucial strategy is role specialization. Within a multi-agent system, different agents can be assigned specialized roles, each leveraging their unique expertise – potentially enhanced by an MOE architecture – to contribute to the overarching goal.<sup>27</sup> This mirrors the dynamics of human teams, where individuals with specific skills and knowledge collaborate to achieve a common objective.<sup>27</sup> For instance, in a supply chain optimization scenario, one agent might specialize in demand forecasting while another focuses on ensuring timely order fulfillment.<sup>27</sup></p><p>Effective collaboration also relies heavily on knowledge sharing. Agents must be able to exchange critical information, observations, and insights derived from their respective modalities or expert domains.<sup>29</sup> This sharing of knowledge contributes to a collective understanding of the problem at hand and informs the development of potential solutions. The use of shared knowledge bases or ontologies can further enhance this process by ensuring consistent interpretation of terms and concepts across different agents.<sup>33</sup></p><p>Coordination mechanisms play a vital role in managing the interactions between multiple agents. These mechanisms can range from centralized coordination, where a supervisor agent analyzes input, breaks down problems, and delegates tasks to sub-agents, to decentralized coordination, where agents interact directly with each other using defined communication protocols.<sup>28</sup> Agentic orchestration platforms are also being developed to provide a structured environment for managing complex workflows and ensuring seamless collaboration between agents.<sup>35</sup></p><p>In many scenarios, agents will engage in iterative refinement. This involves agents working both in parallel and sequentially, building upon each other’s outputs and iteratively improving the quality of the final result.<sup>36</sup> Cooperative agents, in particular, play a crucial role in this process by scrutinizing each other’s contributions and collaboratively enhancing the overall outcome.<sup>36</sup> The Mixture of Agents (MoA) paradigm exemplifies this approach, where layers of specialized LLM agents work together, with proposers generating diverse responses and aggregators synthesizing them into a high-quality final output.<sup>36</sup></p><p>Effective collaboration among multi-modal MOE agents will likely necessitate a dynamic and adaptive approach. This approach will leverage the unique strengths of each agent through role specialization, facilitate seamless knowledge exchange using standardized protocols and ontologies, employ appropriate coordination mechanisms to manage the inherent complexity of multi-agent systems, and encourage the iterative refinement of solutions to achieve optimal outcomes for intricate tasks. For example, Amazon Bedrock employs a supervisor-subagent model where a central agent coordinates specialized sub-agents to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, demonstrating a hierarchical approach to collaboration.<sup>28</sup> In contrast, multi-agent workflows in areas like supply chain optimization might involve more decentralized interactions, with agents directly communicating to manage inventory and fulfillment.<sup>27</sup> The emerging MoA framework further highlights the potential of cooperative agents to iteratively improve the quality of responses by building upon each other’s outputs, showcasing a more fluid and dynamic collaboration strategy.<sup>36</sup></p><h2 id="5-benefits-of-autonomous-multi-agent-interaction"><strong>5. Benefits of Autonomous Multi-Agent Interaction</strong></h2>
<p>The autonomous interaction of multi-modal MOE agents presents a compelling array of potential benefits that promise to revolutionize various aspects of technology and industry.</p><p>One of the most significant advantages is the potential for increased efficiency. Autonomous agents can automate complex, multi-step processes and workflows without the need for constant human intervention.<sup>28</sup> This leads to substantial reductions in task completion times and a more optimal utilization of resources.<sup>38</sup> Furthermore, these agents can handle multiple tasks concurrently and adapt to changing conditions in real-time, significantly enhancing operational efficiency across diverse domains.<sup>39</sup> Communication among networked AI agents, for instance, enables them to work together towards a common goal much more efficiently than a single agent operating in isolation.<sup>17</sup></p><p>Autonomous multi-agent interaction also offers improved scalability. These systems can readily handle increasing workloads and data volumes by dynamically adding or removing agents as needed, providing a flexible and cost-effective solution for managing fluctuating demands.<sup>17</sup> This scalability facilitates the deployment of AI solutions across large and distributed systems without requiring fundamental architectural overhauls.<sup>29</sup></p><p>The multi-modal nature of these agents contributes to enhanced accuracy. By performing cross-verification of data obtained from diverse sources, they can significantly reduce the likelihood of errors and improve the reliability of decision-making processes.<sup>35</sup> This capability helps minimize the human errors often associated with manual tasks and data processing, leading to more dependable outcomes.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Another key benefit is the 24/7 availability of autonomous agents. Unlike human workers, these agents can operate continuously around the clock without requiring breaks or rest, ensuring uninterrupted service and support across different time zones.<sup>40</sup> This continuous operation enables real-time responses and proactive problem-solving at any time, enhancing the responsiveness and resilience of various systems.<sup>29</sup></p><p>The automation of tasks and processes through autonomous multi-agent interaction can also lead to substantial cost reduction. By taking over tasks traditionally performed by human labor, organizations can achieve significant savings in operational expenses, freeing up human employees to concentrate on more strategic and creative endeavors.<sup>39</sup> Moreover, the intelligent automation facilitated by these agents can optimize resource allocation and minimize waste, further contributing to cost efficiencies.<sup>42</sup></p><p>In essence, the autonomous interaction of multi-modal MOE agents presents a powerful pathway to significant operational advantages. These include enhanced efficiency in task execution, improved scalability to meet varying demands, greater accuracy in data processing and decision-making, continuous availability for round-the-clock operation, and substantial reductions in operational costs. These benefits collectively drive innovation and transform business processes across a multitude of industries. For example, intelligent AI agents can blend seamlessly into existing business systems, autonomously managing complex, multi-step processes with minimal oversight, leading to “hands-off” automation solutions.<sup>38</sup> The ability of networked agents to share data and refine strategies based on real-time information further underscores the potential for significant efficiency gains.<sup>17</sup></p><h2 id="6-challenges-and-considerations-efficiency-privacy-and-security"><strong>6. Challenges and Considerations: Efficiency, Privacy, and Security</strong></h2>
<p>While the potential of autonomous multi-agent interaction is vast, realizing its benefits necessitates careful consideration and proactive management of several inherent challenges related to efficiency, privacy, and security.</p><p>Efficiency in communication and coordination can become a significant hurdle as the number of interacting agents increases.<sup>7</sup> The overhead associated with agents exchanging messages and synchronizing their actions can potentially lead to performance bottlenecks if not managed effectively through efficient protocols and message management strategies.<sup>7</sup> Coordinating and synchronizing the activities of a large number of autonomous agents, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments, presents a considerable challenge.<sup>28</sup> Furthermore, ensuring optimal resource allocation and load balancing across the specialized MOE experts within and across interacting agents requires sophisticated mechanisms.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Privacy is another critical concern. Autonomous agents often require access to, process, and exchange sensitive personal or organizational data across multiple modalities.<sup>2</sup> This raises significant risks of unintended data exposure or misuse if appropriate safeguards are not in place.<sup>2</sup> Obtaining informed consent and ensuring robust data governance become particularly challenging when agents operate autonomously on behalf of users or organizations.<sup>46</sup> Moreover, enabling secure collaboration between agents from different entities without compromising the privacy and security of their users’ sensitive information requires the adoption of privacy-preserving techniques.<sup>48</sup></p><p>Security risks are also paramount. The autonomous nature and extensive access privileges of AI agents make them potential targets for cyberattacks, data breaches, and adversarial manipulation.<sup>2</sup> Malicious actors could potentially compromise agents, leading to unauthorized actions, the exfiltration of sensitive data, or the disruption of critical systems.<sup>52</sup> Establishing robust authentication, authorization, and continuous monitoring mechanisms is essential to secure inter-agent communication and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.<sup>52</sup></p><p>Beyond these technical challenges, ethical considerations are crucial. Autonomous agents trained on potentially biased data may exhibit those biases in their actions and decisions, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.<sup>2</sup> The decision-making processes of complex AI agents can often lack transparency and explainability, making it difficult to understand and audit their actions.<sup>47</sup> Furthermore, establishing clear lines of accountability and responsibility for the actions and outcomes of autonomous AI agents presents a significant challenge.<sup>2</sup></p><p>In summary, while the autonomous interaction of multi-modal MOE agents offers tremendous potential, its successful and responsible implementation hinges on proactively addressing the challenges related to managing efficiency at scale, safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data, ensuring robust security against a range of threats, and navigating the complex ethical landscape to build trust and ensure positive societal impact. For example, limitations in data transmission and network latency can impact the efficiency of communication between a growing number of agents.<sup>43</sup> Privacy risks arise from the extensive data access required for autonomous operation, necessitating strict compliance with data protection regulations.<sup>44</sup> Security vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and robust guardrails.<sup>44</sup> Finally, biases in training data can lead to unfair outcomes, underscoring the importance of transparency and accountability in AI agent behavior.<sup>59</sup></p><h2 id="7-autonomous-negotiation-and-agreement-in-ai-agent-systems"><strong>7. Autonomous Negotiation and Agreement in AI Agent Systems</strong></h2>
<p>A key aspect of effective collaboration among autonomous multi-modal MOE agents is their ability to negotiate and reach agreements without direct human intervention. This involves several intricate mechanisms.</p><p>Intent recognition plays a crucial role, enabling AI agents to infer the goals, intentions, and preferences of other agents by observing their actions, communication patterns, and interactions with the environment.<sup>63</sup> This goes beyond simply recognizing a sequence of actions to understanding the underlying intent or overall goal of another agent.<sup>63</sup> Machine learning techniques and contextual understanding can further enhance the accuracy of intent recognition in complex multi-agent scenarios.<sup>66</sup> For instance, an agent might observe another agent repeatedly attempting to access a specific resource and infer its intent to utilize that resource for a particular task.<sup>65</sup></p><p>Negotiation protocols provide the structured sets of rules and standards that govern the negotiation process between AI agents.<sup>15</sup> These protocols define how agents make proposals, issue counter-offers, and ultimately reach mutually acceptable agreements in both cooperative and competitive settings.<sup>15</sup> Various types of negotiation protocols exist, including auction-based mechanisms where agents bid competitively for resources or tasks, contract net protocols where agents announce tasks and bid to complete them, and argumentation-based approaches where agents exchange reasoned arguments to justify their positions.<sup>69</sup></p><p>Conflict resolution strategies are essential for situations where autonomous AI agents encounter disagreements, competing objectives, or conflicting actions.<sup>71</sup> These strategies can involve further negotiation, the use of mediation by a designated agent, or the application of predefined ethical principles or rules to resolve the conflict.<sup>71</sup> For example, if two agents simultaneously attempt to access a limited resource, a conflict resolution strategy might involve a negotiation process to determine which agent has a higher priority or can utilize the resource more efficiently.<sup>71</sup></p><p>Game theory offers a powerful mathematical framework for modeling strategic interactions between negotiating AI agents.<sup>70</sup> By applying game-theoretic principles, agents can analyze potential outcomes, predict the behavior of other agents, and choose optimal strategies to maximize their own utility or the utility of the user they represent.<sup>70</sup> Concepts like Nash Equilibrium, where no agent can improve its outcome by unilaterally changing its strategy, and Pareto Efficiency, where it’s impossible to make one agent better off without making another worse off, are particularly relevant in AI agent negotiation.<sup>76</sup></p><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides another promising avenue for training AI agents to negotiate effectively.<sup>81</sup> Through repeated interactions, experience, and feedback (in the form of rewards or punishments) in simulated or real-world environments, agents can learn to refine their negotiation tactics and adapt their behavior based on the actions of other agents and the dynamics of the environment.<sup>87</sup> This allows agents to develop sophisticated negotiation policies without explicit programming.<sup>86</sup></p><p>Autonomous negotiation and agreement in AI agent systems will likely involve a combination of these mechanisms. Agents will need to accurately recognize the intentions of others, adhere to established negotiation protocols, employ appropriate conflict resolution strategies, and leverage game-theoretic reasoning or reinforcement learning to optimize negotiation outcomes in a variety of scenarios, from simple resource allocation to complex contract agreements. For instance, AI agents are being developed to autonomously negotiate contracts in procurement, aiming to secure the best possible terms by analyzing historical data and market trends.<sup>69</sup></p><h2 id="8-the-necessity-of-human-oversight-and-confirmation"><strong>8. The Necessity of Human Oversight and Confirmation</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the increasing sophistication of autonomous AI agents, human oversight and confirmation remain crucial for ensuring their responsible and beneficial operation.</p><p>Ethical considerations necessitate human involvement to ensure that the actions and decisions of autonomous AI agents align with human values, societal norms, and ethical principles.<sup>60</sup> This helps mitigate the risk of unintended harmful or biased outcomes that might arise from purely autonomous decision-making.<sup>60</sup> Establishing clear ethical guidelines and frameworks to govern the behavior of AI agents is essential for their responsible deployment.<sup>60</sup></p><p>Safety and risk mitigation are also key reasons for human oversight. Human intervention serves as a vital safety net, preventing autonomous agents from making critical errors or engaging in unintended behaviors that could lead to negative consequences, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare or finance.<sup>44</sup> Approaches like “human-in-the-loop” and “human-on-the-loop” allow for necessary guidance and control over autonomous systems.<sup>60</sup></p><p>Legal and regulatory compliance demands human oversight to ensure that the actions of AI agents adhere to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, especially in highly regulated sectors.<sup>44</sup> As the legal landscape surrounding AI continues to evolve, human accountability for the actions of autonomous systems remains paramount.<sup>55</sup></p><p>For complex or high-stakes decisions, human confirmation or approval is often essential.<sup>3</sup> This is particularly true for decisions or agreements that carry significant financial, legal, or ethical implications.<sup>3</sup> Multi-signature schemes, for example, can require both human and AI agent approval for sensitive transactions, providing an added layer of security and control.<sup>111</sup></p><p>Maintaining user trust is another critical aspect. Human oversight and the ability for users to monitor and control the actions of AI agents are crucial for building and sustaining trust in these autonomous systems.<sup>105</sup> Transparency and explainability in AI decision-making processes further contribute to user confidence.<sup>60</sup></p><p>While the long-term vision might involve increasingly autonomous AI agents, the current stage of development necessitates robust human oversight and confirmation mechanisms. These mechanisms are vital for addressing ethical considerations, ensuring safety and compliance with regulations, handling complex and high-stakes decisions responsibly, and ultimately building the trust required for the widespread adoption of these powerful technologies. For instance, in financial transactions, a setup where an autonomous agent proposes transactions but requires approval from human signers provides enhanced security and control.<sup>111</sup> Similarly, in high-risk applications, human oversight ensures that AI decisions align with ethical guidelines and legal frameworks.<sup>105</sup></p><h2 id="9-enhancing-communication-dynamic-function-calls-and-code-exchange"><strong>9. Enhancing Communication: Dynamic Function Calls and Code Exchange</strong></h2>
<p>To further enhance the efficiency and capabilities of multi-modal MOE AI agents, advanced communication methods beyond natural language are being explored, including dynamic function calls and code exchange.</p><p>Dynamic function calls allow AI agents to interact with external tools, access specific data, or trigger particular actions in a more structured and efficient manner compared to relying solely on natural language instructions.<sup>114</sup> By defining the structure of functions and their parameters, agents can precisely specify the actions they need to perform, leading to reduced ambiguity and more direct execution of tasks through well-defined interfaces.<sup>115</sup> For example, an agent might use a function call to retrieve the current weather information for a specific location or to add an event to a user’s calendar.<sup>114</sup></p><p>The exchange of code between AI agents represents another powerful advanced communication method.<sup>118</sup> This allows agents to share specialized capabilities or algorithms that might not be readily available through standard APIs or natural language commands.<sup>19</sup> By exchanging and executing code snippets, agents can potentially achieve more efficient collaboration and problem-solving, leveraging the unique functionalities developed by others.<sup>19</sup> For instance, one agent specializing in a particular type of data analysis could share a code function with another agent that needs to perform that specific analysis.<sup>118</sup></p><p>Dynamic function calls and code exchange offer several advantages over natural language communication. They can lead to increased speed of interaction, reduced potential for misinterpretation or ambiguity, and enhanced precision in specifying actions and data formats.<sup>117</sup> These methods enable agents to interact with greater efficiency and directly invoke specific functionalities or share complex logic.</p><p>However, the exchange and execution of code between autonomous AI agents introduces significant security risks.<sup>19</sup> The potential for malicious code injection, unauthorized access to systems, or overall compromise necessitates the implementation of robust security measures.<sup>19</sup> Sandboxing environments, rigorous code verification processes, and the establishment of trust mechanisms between agents are crucial for mitigating these risks and ensuring safe and secure code exchange.<sup>56</sup></p><p>In conclusion, dynamic function calls and the exchange of code represent powerful advanced communication methods that can significantly enhance the efficiency and flexibility of interaction between multi-modal MOE AI agents. They enable agents to perform complex tasks and share specialized capabilities more effectively than natural language alone. Nevertheless, the potential security implications associated with executing code from other agents underscore the critical need for implementing stringent security protocols and establishing trust frameworks to ensure safe and reliable communication. For example, the AI-Exchange Protocol (AIXP) has been proposed as a standard to facilitate the exchange of information, potentially including code, between AI agents.<sup>118</sup> While function calling provides a structured way for agents to use external tools <sup>114</sup>, the direct exchange of executable code requires careful security considerations to prevent potential vulnerabilities.<sup>19</sup></p><h2 id="10-navigating-cross-entity-collaboration-and-prioritizing-user-interests"><strong>10. Navigating Cross-Entity Collaboration and Prioritizing User Interests</strong></h2>
<p>As multi-modal MOE AI agents become more prevalent, scenarios involving collaboration between agents from different entities will become increasingly common. This raises important questions about how these agents, such as personal AI and company AI, can collaborate effectively while prioritizing the interests of their respective users.</p><p>Collaboration between personal AI agents, acting on behalf of individuals, and company AI agents, representing organizations, presents a unique set of complexities.<sup>1</sup> These agents might have differing goals and priorities, reflecting the distinct objectives of the individuals and the organizations they serve.<sup>1</sup> Aligning these potentially disparate interests when their AI agents interact is a significant challenge.</p><p>To facilitate effective collaboration that respects user interests, mechanisms for preference signaling are essential. AI agents need to be able to communicate and understand the preferences, constraints, and priorities of their respective users during inter-agent interactions.<sup>95</sup> This could involve agents being guided by user-defined rules, accessing preference profiles, or even interpreting natural language instructions from their users to inform their collaborative behavior.<sup>120</sup></p><p>During negotiation processes with agents from other entities, AI agents must be equipped to prioritize and advocate for the best possible outcomes for their own users.<sup>96</sup> This might involve strategic decision-making and the ability to make trade-offs while ensuring that the final agreement aligns with their user’s key objectives or “bottom line”.<sup>120</sup> For instance, an AI agent negotiating a contract on behalf of a user would need to prioritize terms that are most beneficial to that user, potentially making concessions on less critical aspects.<sup>96</sup></p><p>In situations where cross-entity collaboration involves the exchange of sensitive data, privacy-preserving techniques become crucial. Technologies such as federated learning, secure multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs can enable AI agents from different entities to collaborate on tasks or share valuable insights without compromising the privacy and security of their users’ confidential information.<sup>48</sup> This is particularly important in domains like healthcare or finance where data privacy is paramount.</p><p>In conclusion, effective cross-entity collaboration between multi-modal MOE AI agents will necessitate sophisticated mechanisms for preference signaling and negotiation. These mechanisms must enable agents to understand and prioritize the interests of their respective users while interacting with agents from other entities. Furthermore, the integration of privacy-preserving techniques will be essential to ensure secure and trustworthy interactions when exchanging information across organizational or personal boundaries. For example, personal AI agents might need to signal their user’s availability for a meeting to a company AI agent attempting to schedule a team call.<sup>41</sup> In such a scenario, both agents need to prioritize their respective users’ schedules and preferences to find a mutually agreeable time.<sup>41</sup></p><h2 id="11-real-world-applications-and-future-directions"><strong>11. Real-World Applications and Future Directions</strong></h2>
<p>The potential applications of autonomous AI agent interaction are vast and span across numerous real-world scenarios.</p><p>In scheduling and meeting coordination, autonomous multi-modal MOE AI agents can significantly streamline the often cumbersome process of arranging meetings.<sup>41</sup> These agents can intelligently scan participants’ calendars, considering individual preferences, time zones, and availability to propose optimal meeting times, thereby eliminating the need for extensive back-and-forth communication.<sup>41</sup></p><p>Customer service is another area ripe for transformation. AI agents with multi-modal capabilities, such as understanding both text and voice inputs, can collaborate to handle complex customer inquiries, provide personalized support, and resolve issues with greater efficiency.<sup>124</sup> These agents can access customer history, leverage knowledge bases, and even escalate complex issues to human agents when necessary, ensuring a seamless and satisfactory customer experience.<sup>125</sup></p><p>Supply chain management stands to benefit immensely from autonomous AI agent interaction. Interacting agents can optimize various aspects of the supply chain, including demand forecasting, inventory management, supplier negotiation, and logistics coordination.<sup>127</sup> This can lead to increased efficiency, reduced costs, and a more resilient and responsive supply chain.<sup>129</sup></p><p>Industrial automation is also being revolutionized by AI agents. In manufacturing and industrial settings, autonomous agents can perform tasks such as predictive maintenance by monitoring equipment health and predicting failures, quality control by analyzing production data in real-time, process optimization by identifying inefficiencies, and coordination of robotic systems on the factory floor.<sup>130</sup> These applications lead to increased productivity, reduced downtime, and improved product quality.<sup>133</sup></p><p>Contract negotiation is another promising application. AI agents are being developed to autonomously negotiate contracts in various industries, aiming to secure optimal terms and reduce the need for manual human intervention.<sup>93</sup> These agents can analyze vast amounts of data, understand complex legal language, and negotiate based on predefined goals and constraints.<sup>96</sup></p><p>Looking towards the future, several trends are expected to shape the evolution of AI agent communication and collaboration. We will likely see the development of more sophisticated multi-agent systems capable of tackling increasingly complex problems through coordinated effort.<sup>13</sup> The emergence of standardized communication protocols, such as A2A and MCP, will be crucial for enabling seamless interoperability between agents from different platforms and domains.<sup>13</sup> There will also be a growing focus on incorporating emotional intelligence into AI agents to facilitate more natural and empathetic interactions.<sup>144</sup> Furthermore, ethical AI development and responsible deployment will become increasingly important as these agents become more integrated into our lives.<sup>140</sup></p><p>The autonomous interaction of multi-modal MOE AI agents holds immense potential to transform a wide array of real-world applications across diverse sectors. Future advancements will likely concentrate on enhancing their collaborative capabilities, ensuring their ethical and secure operation, and expanding their integration into increasingly intricate and dynamic environments. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents are already being used for predictive maintenance and quality control.<sup>131</sup> In finance, they are assisting with fraud detection and risk assessment.<sup>146</sup> The continued development and refinement of these applications, along with the emergence of new ones, will undoubtedly shape the future of how we interact with technology and solve complex problems.</p><h2 id="12-conclusion-the-future-landscape-of-interacting-multi-modal-moe-ai-agents"><strong>12.

  <p>
    The digital landscape is saturated with note-taking applications, each promising to be the ultimate solution for organizing thoughts, managing projects, and boosting productivity. From the all-encompassing workspace of Notion to the established ecosystem of Evernote, the interconnected graph of Obsidian, and the simplicity of Google Keep, users have a plethora of options. However, amidst these giants, a lesser-known open-source application, <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>, is quietly amassing power through a unique advantage: its extensive and versatile plugin ecosystem. While often positioned as an underdog, Joplin's ability to be customized and extended through these community-driven additions allows it to not only compete with but, in many ways, surpass the functionality offered by its more mainstream counterparts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
<div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARNt7LFpzpw?si=7NVmCzTwdTiB4zwO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

  <p>
    The core strength of Joplin lies in its adaptability. Unlike some note-taking applications that offer a fixed set of features, Joplin's architecture allows users to selectively enhance its capabilities through plugins. This modular approach provides a significant advantage, enabling individuals to tailor the application precisely to their specific needs and workflows. Instead of being forced to adopt features they don't require, Joplin users can choose from a vast library of extensions that add functionalities ranging from advanced project management tools to specialized academic features. This power of extensibility is Joplin's hidden weapon in its quest to challenge the dominance of the established note-taking giants.
  </p>

    <h2 id="joplins-arsenal-exploring-the-plugin-ecosystem">
      Joplin's Arsenal: Exploring the Plugin Ecosystem
    </h2>

  <p>
    The true potential of Joplin is unlocked by its thriving <a href="https://joplinapp.org/plugins" target="_blank">plugin ecosystem</a>, which currently boasts over 150 extensions. This impressive number is a clear indicator of the active and dedicated community that supports and enhances the application. Installing these plugins is a remarkably user-friendly process. Many plugins can be found and installed directly from within the Joplin application itself through the settings menu. For users who prefer a more hands-on approach or want to explore the latest community contributions, plugins can also be downloaded from platforms like GitHub and installed manually. This dual approach to installation caters to users of all technical skill levels.
  </p>

  <p>
    The breadth of Joplin's plugin ecosystem is truly remarkable, covering a wide spectrum of functionalities designed to enhance productivity, organization, customization, task management, and integration with other tools. For productivity enhancements, plugins like Note Tabs address a common desire to work with multiple notes simultaneously by introducing a familiar tabbed interface. Rich Markdown elevates the writing experience by offering a more visually appealing and customizable Markdown editor. Navigating long documents becomes easier with the Outline plugin, which provides a sidebar table of contents. Consistent formatting is ensured by the Templates plugin, allowing users to create and reuse predefined note structures. Quick access to frequently used items is provided by the Favorites plugin , while the Quick Links plugin streamlines internal linking between notes, fostering a more interconnected knowledge base.
  </p>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.rogverse.fyi/thorium_FwXeqlTMIX.png"  data-is-external-image="true"></p></div>

  <p>
    For users seeking advanced organization capabilities, Joplin offers powerful plugin options. Kanban plugins, such as KanMug and YesYouKan, transform Joplin into a visual task management system, allowing notes to be arranged on customizable boards, similar to Notion's board views or dedicated Kanban applications. To visualize the connections between notes, Graph View plugins like Sepremento's Awesome Graph, Link Graph UI, and Joplin Graph Plugin offer interactive network diagrams, akin to Obsidian's renowned graph view. Enhancing the interconnectedness of notes further, Backlinks plugins like Automatic Backlinks automatically create links from notes that reference the current one, a core feature of Roam Research's approach to knowledge management.
  </p>

  <p>
    The visual appeal and user experience of Joplin can also be tailored through plugins. The macOS Theme provides a native look and feel for macOS users , while the Extra Markdown editor settings plugin offers fine-grained control over the editing environment. Beyond specific themes, Joplin's core functionality supports the use of custom themes, allowing for deep visual customization.
  </p>

  <p>
    Task management within Joplin can be significantly enhanced with dedicated plugins. Inline TODO allows embedding to-dos directly within notes and provides a consolidated summary. Metis offers a straightforward task manager based on the portable Todo.txt format. For tracking time spent on tasks, the Time Slip plugin provides a solution integrated directly within notes. Calendar integration is offered by the Joplin Calendar plugin , while the Journal plugin facilitates daily journaling practices. The Agenda plugin provides a dedicated panel displaying upcoming and overdue tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, Joplin's plugin ecosystem extends its reach through integrations with other valuable tools. The Web Clipper browser extension allows users to save web pages and articles as notes directly into Joplin. The Email to Note plugin enables sending emails to a specific address, which are then automatically converted into Joplin notes. For users of the spaced repetition learning tool Anki, the Anki Sync plugin provides bidirectional synchronization. Developers can even integrate Joplin with their coding workflow using the VSCode Integration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond these core categories, Joplin's plugin repository contains unique and specialized tools that highlight its remarkable flexibility. The Rubi and Furigana Plugin was created to assist users learning Japanese by adding support for ruby characters. The Function Plot Plugin provides the ability to generate mathematical visualizations directly within notes. The Hotfolder plugin automates the process of importing files from a local directory as new notes. The Joplin AI assistant integrates artificial intelligence capabilities for features like related note suggestions. For users who need spreadsheet-like functionality, the JSheets plugin offers a unique solution. Visual thinkers can benefit from the Mindmap Plugin. Lastly, the Automatic Backlinks plugin provides a crucial feature for building interconnected knowledge graphs, a hallmark of applications like Roam Research and Obsidian. These examples demonstrate the platform's capacity to cater to highly specific and diverse user needs.

</p></div>

  <p>
    Notion excels as a versatile workspace, offering a highly flexible block-based system that allows users to create custom pages, databases, and project management tools. Its strong collaboration features and integrations make it a popular choice for teams. However, its extensive functionality can be overwhelming for new users, leading to a steep learning curve. The sheer number of options can also be a source of distraction, and the pricing structure can become prohibitive for larger teams.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Evernote, a long-standing player in the note-taking space, offers robust note-taking features with rich formatting options and an excellent web clipper. Its powerful search functionality, including OCR, and good organizational structure with notebooks and tags are key strengths. However, the free plan has become increasingly restrictive, and the paid plans can be quite expensive. Some users have also reported performance issues and a feeling of the application becoming bloated over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Obsidian, favored by those building personal knowledge graphs, offers a local-first approach, ensuring data ownership and privacy. Built on Markdown, it provides flexibility and longevity for notes. Its highly customizable nature, thanks to a vast plugin ecosystem and themes, is a major draw. The powerful internal linking with backlinks and a graph view for visualizing connections are core features. However, users unfamiliar with Markdown and the concept of a personal knowledge graph might face a steeper learning curve. While the interface is minimalistic, it might not appeal to all users, and official syncing across devices requires a paid subscription.
  </p>

  <p>
    Microsoft OneNote, often pre-installed on Windows devices, is free to use and integrates seamlessly with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Its flexible page layout allows for freeform note placement, and its strong inking capabilities are excellent for handwritten notes and annotations. However, some users find it can feel bloated with features, and syncing issues across devices are occasionally reported. Compared to some other options, it places less emphasis on privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apple Notes, free for Apple users, offers deep integration within the Apple ecosystem, providing seamless syncing across devices. Its user interface is simple and intuitive, making it excellent for quick note-taking, and it offers secure notes with Face ID/Touch ID locking. However, compared to more advanced applications, its feature set is limited, and it is only available within the Apple ecosystem. Syncing reliability has also been questioned by some users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Google Keep stands out for its simplicity and speed in capturing quick notes, lists, and reminders, and it's completely free. Its excellent integration with other Google Workspace apps is a significant advantage for many users. However, it offers very limited formatting options and lacks a hierarchical organization system with notebooks. Its task management capabilities are basic, and it does not have a dedicated desktop application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Roam Research has pioneered the concept of bi-directional linking, allowing users to create highly interconnected knowledge networks. Its graph view provides a unique way to visualize the relationships between notes, and it focuses on networked thought and discovering emergent connections. However, it is one of the most expensive note-taking applications available and can have a steep learning curve due to its unconventional approach. Its reliance on cloud storage might also be a concern for privacy-conscious users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logseq, a free and open-source alternative, offers a local-first approach, prioritizing data privacy. Its outliner-based structure encourages breaking down thoughts into interconnected blocks, and it features strong bi-directional linking and graph view capabilities. It also includes useful features like flashcards and PDF annotation. However, users unfamiliar with outliner workflows might experience a steeper learning curve, and its user interface might feel less polished than some commercial options. The mobile apps are currently in beta.
  </p>

  <p>
    Craft provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface with a block-based editor focused on creating well-structured documents. Its strong collaboration features allow for real-time sharing and co-editing of documents. However, it is primarily cloud-based, which might concern users who prefer local storage. It also places less emphasis on plain Markdown editing compared to some other applications and can become expensive for individual users after the free tier.
