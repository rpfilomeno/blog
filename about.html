Back around 2002-2003, I jumped into the burgeoning world of mobile technology. Like many in those early days, I found myself wearing quite a few hats, often juggling different roles simultaneously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My initial foray was as a Systems Developer, building applications for what was then the cutting edge: mobile services like SMS and MMS. Think back – this was a time before ubiquitous smartphones and app stores. We were figuring out how to connect mobile platforms, sometimes across continents, using standards like SOAP and WSDL. At Finger Apps, I dove deep into server-side development for wireless services and got my first taste of project conceptualization and management, even working on Friendster's mobile platform integration in the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That led me to MegaMobile, where the "multiple hats" theme really took hold. I was both a Mobile Specialist and an R&amp;D Specialist. One moment I'd be strategizing how to monetize digital products for mobile markets, the next I'd be managing the operational aspects of ad placements, designing campaigns with Augmented Reality, or leading development teams. It was a dynamic period, constantly adapting and finding solutions, whether for clients or internal infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My path wasn't confined to one place or even one specialty. I took on roles ranging from CTO for an e-commerce outfit based in the US, managing projects across Melbourne, Singapore, and Dubai for iPay, to consulting for a UK-based company. This international exposure broadened my perspective immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, my focus shifted towards the foundational elements of modern IT. As a Senior System Architect and later specializing in IT Governance, Risk, and Compliance (IT-GRC), I delved into Cloud Computing, IT infrastructure management, virtualization, and ensuring data security. It was about building and securing the robust systems that everything else runs on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now? I've founded ROGVERSE. Here, I'm channeling all that experience into the exciting field of AI Solutions Engineering. We're exploring conversational AI for the telecom and entertainment industries – things like AI-driven customer support, virtual entertainers, and smarter business intelligence. It feels like coming full circle in some ways, applying the latest tech wave to industries I've known for years, but with tools and possibilities we could only dream of back when I started. It's been quite a ride, and the learning never stops! &nbsp;<br></p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://web.facebook.com/ilovejelatin" class="facebook" aria-label="Facebook"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://roger.rogverse.fyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://x.com/godie" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://roger.rogverse.fyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rpfilomeno/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://roger.rogverse.fyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@godiegaming" class="youtube" aria-label="Youtube"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://roger.rogverse.fyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">A.I.2.mations 2025 All rights reserved</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://roger.rogverse.fyi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
